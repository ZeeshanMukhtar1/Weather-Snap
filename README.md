WeatherSnap

## Project Preview  
[WeatherSnap](https://weathersnap.netlify.app/)

## Description 
Weather Snap is a web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions in any location by using the OpenWeatherMap API. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and covers several core concepts in web development.

## Core concepts i have covered
- <small>JS Event Listeners: The app uses Load event listener in JavaScript when the Window gets load</small>
- <small>CSS Flexbox: The app's layout is built using CSS Flexbox, which allows for responsive and flexible design. This ensures that the app can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</small>
- <small>Fetch API in JS: The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the Fetch API in JavaScript.</small>
- <small>Interacting with the DOM: The app interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript to dynamically update the UI based on user input and data retrieved from the API</small>
- <small>The app uses the Navigator object in JavaScript to get the user's current location. This makes it possible to automatically display the weather conditions for the user's location without the need for manual input.</small>

## Resources i have used  
- <small>[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)</small>
